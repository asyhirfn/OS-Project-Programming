## Algorithms

- FCFS DISC SCHEDULING - FCFS_DISK_SCHEDULING.cpp
- Page Replacement Algorithm - PAGE_REPLACEMENT_ALGORITHM.cpp

## How to compile on Windows

1. Make sure you have g++ compiler installed in your computer.
2. Open command prompt terminal.
3. Run this command to compile.

```
g++ -o FCFS_DISK_SCHEDULING FCFS_DISK_SCHEDULING.cpp
```

4. Run the program

```
FCFS_DISK_SCHEDULING.exe
```

## If can't compile in windows

- Download all the folder and codes and manually run it using your compiler in your machine.

5. After running the fcfs disc scheduling program, you can check the output in the 'OutputPart1' folder to see the result of program.
6. To try another case, you just need to re-run the program.
7. To compile another cpp file, follow the previous step but with different file name.
8. Every output is related with the input file using with their number in the file name.(ie: inputfile1|outputfile1)
